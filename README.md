# 🌳 `treefetch`

A lightning-fast minimalist system fetch tool made in Rust. Even faster than neofetch and pfetch. Made to practice my new Rust skills 🦀.

A great pair for [cbonsai](https://gitlab.com/jallbrit/cbonsai), to help you get upvotes on your Linux rice.

More trees with `treefetch --bonsai` and `treefetch --xmas`!
